# water

This is the Earthshot Labs repo for water projects. These projects are designed to support/accelerate carbon sequestration and co-benefits.

This repository exists initially to provide a usable repo on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for python scripts for [google earth engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).

To contribute, discuss, get help, etc... please visit the \#water channel in the [slack workspace](https://earthshotclimate.slack.com).
